We were asked to redesign their website for one of their databases. They wanted to build a modern website that was easier to navigate, they wanted to keep all original content but presented in a modern and user-friendly way. This project took us about 6 months to work on, the project grow over time and took many iterations for the design and layout of the site.

We were responsible for all stages of the development and design of this project.',

We built a  platform that is interactive for users and helps give user\'s light on the database. The platform was built using a PostgreSQL database with express and knex. Data visualization was built using Leaflet geoJson and timelapse extensions, with jQuery.',
