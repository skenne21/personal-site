        <h3>WHO AM I AS A PERSON?</h3>
        <p>As a Colorado Native, I love spending my free time in the mountains
         no matter the activity or the type of shoes I have on my feet. I also love
         a great cup of coffee, a good book, or listening to a great podcast.
        </p>
        <p>My path as a Front-End Developer has lead me to focus on Javascript. I love
        the diversity and flexibility that Javascript allows when I am innovating my
        ideas into reality with code.
        </p>
        <p>I was driven towards a career in web development because I love the challenge
        and the reward of figuring out a problem or learning a new language.
        As a former Trainer, I loved working with clients and helping them solve
        there own barriers with fitness and nutrition. I was invested into their
        goals, I bookmarked my own success by seeing and driving my clients to reach
         their goals. I bring this same drive and passion into the code I create. I
         bookmark a completion of a project as a personal win and get fully invested
         into seeing the full lifecycle of a project or idea. I am driven to create
         and innovate code that makes a meaningful impact on community and individuals
         lives.
